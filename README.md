## This is my prep work for the onsite round of HRT
The materials here are produced as a guesswork at what
might come up in the onsite, which is allegedly the most difficult part
of getting into HRT.

### JD: [HRT Python SWE Intern](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/hrt-job/software-engineering-internship-summer-2026-2/)
<sup>originally posted late Oct, reposted early Dec</sup>
### Sources of Info:
- OA, round1, and round2
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Hudson-River-Trading-Interview-Questions-E470937.htm?filter.jobTitleExact=Software+Engineer(Internship)&filter.jobTitleFTS=Software+Engineer(Internship))
which I rummaged thru inside out upside down. Trust me on this.
- cyber-stalking exising hrt employee / interviewers' code projects, repos, blogs, articles, etc. 
- Prof's tip. CS9223 prof is of senior position at this company. 

### Scope and Coverage:
- [String Manipulation (with and without regex)](./Strs)
- [Mathematical algorithms (specifically **NOT** Leetcode style)](./Algos)
- [Python Low-level primitives, space&time analysis](./Prims)
- [System design with ``asyncio``](./IOs)

### Methodology:
The point is interview prep, thus all code comes with
verbose comments intended as a mock of "talk as you code"
interview performance. The algorithms are revised and improved with 
chatGPT 5.2, but are mostly conceived and developed in a way
to be uncheatable with LLM assistance based on common OA and Interview
design pattern I observed in Fall/Winter 2025 recruiting season.
